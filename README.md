**Agent Mailer Protocol (AMP)** is a self-hosted async mail protocol for AI agents. It gives every agent a durable identity, an inbox, threaded messages, and an operator console, so planners, coders, reviewers, and custom agents can coordinate without sharing one fragile chat context.

If you want Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Dreamfactory, Linkyun Infiniti Agent, or your own agent runtime to collaborate through explicit message handoffs, this is the broker.

Want to run Planner, Coder, Reviewer, and Runner on the cloud demo? Start with the **[Multi-Agent Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)**.

New install? Start here: **run `./run.sh`, open `/admin/ui`, create an API key, then send an agent to `/setup.md`.**

## Install (recommended)

Runtime: **Python 3.11+**. Package manager: **uv**.

```bash
uv sync

cat > .env <<'EOF'
AGENT_MAILER_SECRET_KEY=change-this-secret
EOF

./run.sh
```

Open the local console:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9800/admin/ui
```

On first launch, the server prints a bootstrap invite code. Use it to register the first user; that user becomes the superadmin.

## Quick start (TL;DR)

```bash
# Start the broker
./run.sh

# Open these in your browser
open http://127.0.0.1:9800
open http://127.0.0.1:9800/admin/ui

# Ask an AI agent to self-register
read http://127.0.0.1:9800/setup.md to register your agent to the broker
```

After the human operator provides an API key, the agent registers itself, downloads its identity files, writes `AGENT.md` or `SOUL.md`, and starts checking its inbox.

## One-command local agent team

This is the shortest local workflow for running a four-agent team backed by a
remote or local Agent Mailer broker.

Install the CLI globally once:

```bash
uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/study8677/agent-mailer.git
```

Log in once:

```bash
amp login http://your-broker:9800 user
```

Then open any project directory and start the Codex team:

```bash
cd ~/work/your-project
amp codex
```

Or start the Claude Code team:

```bash
amp claude-code
```

You do not need to create a team directory, clone another repo, or open four
terminal windows manually. `amp codex` does the full bootstrap:

- chooses a team name from the current folder, such as `your-project-codex`;
- creates `~/amp-teams/<team-name>` automatically;
- records the current folder as the real project directory and links it into each agent workdir as `project`;
- registers or refreshes `planner`, `coder`, `reviewer`, and `runner` on the broker;
- writes `team.yaml`, `agents/`, `start-team.sh`, and `stop-team.sh`;
- starts one tmux session with four `agent-mailer watch` processes.

Stop or restart the most recent team:

```bash
amp stop
amp start
```

`amp stop` with no name first checks whether the current directory is already a
generated team directory. Otherwise it stops the most recently created or
started `amp` team.

If you want a named team, pass the name after the runtime:

```bash
amp codex project-a
amp claude-code project-a
```

Those create `project-a-codex` or `project-a-claude-code` under `~/amp-teams/`.
You can still stop the latest team with `amp stop`; to target it explicitly:

```bash
amp stop project-a-codex
```

On first run, `amp` asks for the broker URL, username, and password. After that,
it reuses the saved login from `~/.agent-mailer/credentials.json`. You can still
pass everything explicitly with `--broker-url`, `--username`, and `--dir`.

Requirements: `tmux` plus a logged-in local runtime CLI, either `codex` for
`amp codex` or `claude` for `amp claude-code`.

The short runtime commands default to full local permissions:
`permission_mode = "bypassPermissions"`. This lets Codex or Claude Code read
the original project directory and call the broker without approval prompts. To
run a more restrictive team, pass `--permission-mode acceptEdits` or
`--permission-mode plan`.

The older explicit commands remain available for scripts:

```bash
amp up project-a --runtime codex
amp init project-a
amp start project-a
amp stop project-a
```

The generated `agents/` directories contain API keys in `.agent-mailer/config.toml`, so `amp` also updates `.gitignore` for the local team artifacts.

### Local team data and operations

Real mail is stored in the Broker database, not in the local agent workdirs. The
current production/NY server uses SQLite at
`/root/agent-mailer-data/agent_mailer.db`, with mail rows in the `messages`
table. Local agents keep only runtime state and memory; they do not persist full
message bodies locally.

Each local agent lives under:

```text
~/amp-teams/<team>/agents/<agent>
```

Common files in that directory:

- `AGENT.md` — runtime identity and operating instructions.
- `project` — symlink to the real project directory.
- `.agent-mailer/config.toml` — broker URL, agent address, and API key.
- `log.jsonl` — local watcher/runtime log.
- `processed.txt` — processed message IDs.
- `cursor.txt` — inbox polling cursor.
- `inflight.json` — currently running message/thread state.
- `sessions.json` — runtime session mapping, when present.
- `dead_letter.jsonl` and `retries.json` — failed or retryable work, when present.
- `memory/` — persistent memory files for the agent.

Memory is split by scope. `memory/global.md` is long-term memory across threads.
`memory/<thread_id>.md` stores handoff notes for one mail thread. Before each
message is handled, the generated prompt asks the agent to read both global and
thread memory; after handling, it asks the agent to update the thread memory.

Use one unique team name per project. For example, use `opencmo-codex` for the
`opencmo` project and `another-project-codex` for another project. The team
directory, tmux session, and agent names are all separated by team name. Do not
reuse the same team name for different projects, because that refreshes the same
agents and API keys on the Broker.

Codex and Claude Code teams are intentionally named separately:
`<name>-codex` and `<name>-claude-code`.

Common management commands:

```bash
ls ~/amp-teams
tmux ls | grep '^amp-'
amp start <team>
amp stop <team>
amp stop
tmux attach -t amp-<team>
```

## Highlights

- **Async mail primitives** — `send`, `reply`, `forward`, `inbox`, read/unread, and full thread lookup.
- **Durable agent identity** — registered agents own addresses like `coder@alice.amp.linkyun.co`.
- **Operator Console** — browser UI for inboxes, threads, search, compose, archives, trash, tags, stats, API keys, and teams.
- **Team memory** — save important messages into shared memories that agents can read later.
- **Multi-tenant by default** — invite-code signup, session login, API keys, superadmin controls, and tenant-isolated messaging.
- **Local and production modes** — SQLite for local development; PostgreSQL and Docker Compose for production.

## How it works

```text
Human Operator
     |
     | send
     v
Planner Agent  --forward-->  Coder Agent  --forward-->  Reviewer Agent
                                       ^                 |
                                       |                 |
                                       +------reply------+
```

Each agent receives a generated identity file such as `AGENT.md` or `SOUL.md`. Adapter files like `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `CLAW.md`, `DREAMER.md`, or `INFINITI.md` load that identity so the agent knows:

- who it is,
- which mailbox address it owns,
- which broker URL to call,
- how to check inbox and send messages,
- what system prompt and responsibilities it should follow.

## Headless agent runtime: `agent-mailer` CLI

In addition to the broker, this repo ships **`agent-mailer`**, a per-workdir
client runtime that turns an Agent Mailer Protocol agent into an unattended
service. Instead of a human running an agent CLI and typing `/check-inbox`, the
CLI polls the broker, decides whether to resume an existing runtime session
or start a fresh one, spawns headless Claude Code or Codex, and persists state under
`<workdir>/.agent-mailer/`.

### Install

```bash
# Per-user, isolated venv (recommended)
uv tool install agent-mailer

# Or, from this repo while developing
uv sync
uv run agent-mailer --help
```

After registration via `setup.md`, the agent's workdir already has
`.agent-mailer/config.toml` written. Subsequent runs just need:

```bash
cd ~/workspaces/coder
agent-mailer watch
```

The first call to `watch` launches a small wizard: it confirms the agent
identity loaded from `AGENT.md` / `config.toml`, asks for the API key if
missing, and forces an explicit choice of `permission_mode`
(`acceptEdits` / `bypassPermissions` / `plan`). Subsequent runs read the
config directly without prompting.

Select Codex either during setup or in config:

```bash
agent-mailer init --runtime codex
agent-mailer config set runtime codex
```

Claude uses `claude -p ...`; Codex uses `codex exec ...`. Make sure the
matching CLI is installed and logged in before starting `agent-mailer watch`.

### Subcommand surface

| Group | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Setup | `init`, `config show\|set\|edit`, `verify`, `doctor` |
| Operate | `watch`, `status`, `logs --tail N --grep PATTERN` |
| Sessions | `sessions {list,show,invalidate,prune --older-than 14d}` |
| Memory | `memory {show,edit,ls}` (handoff notes per thread + global) |
| Recovery | `dead-letter {list,retry <msg_id>,purge}` |
| Debug | `fetch <msg_id>`, `test-claude` |

`agent-mailer watch` enforces the SPEC's safety invariants: config files
must be `0600` (directory `0700`), the agent_id in `AGENT.md` must match
the one in `config.toml` (override with `--ignore-agent-md-mismatch`),
and exactly one watcher process per workdir (file lock). When a runtime
turn fails, the message goes through up to `max_retries` retries before
landing in `.agent-mailer/dead_letter.jsonl`, which you can inspect or
re-queue with `agent-mailer dead-letter`.

### Run as a background service

A reference systemd user unit lives at `packaging/agent-mailer.service.example`.
Copy it to `~/.config/systemd/user/agent-mailer@<workdir>.service`, edit
the `WorkingDirectory` line, then:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now agent-mailer@coder.service
journalctl --user -u agent-mailer@coder.service -f
```

For a per-workdir CLI specification (state files, prompt templates,
session resume rules, fault-tolerance state machine), see `SPEC.md`.

## Supported agent runtimes

| Runtime | Adapter file | Identity file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENT.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | `AGENT.md` |
| OpenClaw | `CLAW.md` | `AGENT.md` |
| Dreamfactory | `DREAMER.md` | `SOUL.md` |
| Linkyun Infiniti Agent | `INFINITI.md` | `SOUL.md` |
| Custom agent | Your loader | `AGENT.md` or `SOUL.md` |

## One-click team via `/zudui` (Claude Code)

If you run Claude Code, the [`zudui` skill](.claude/skills/zudui/) bundled in this repo bootstraps a multi-agent team via fully conversational chat — it collects the roles you want, registers each on the broker, writes per-role `AGENT.md`, and drops a smart tmux/iTerm2 launcher that boots N panes to working state with **zero human keystrokes**. The launcher pre-accepts Claude Code's workspace-trust dialog and auto-dismisses the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` warning so autonomous agents don't deadlock at boot.

```bash
# In Claude Code, from your team's mother dir:
> /zudui            # conversational team setup
> ./start-team.sh   # spawns the tmux session; agents start polling
```

Pairs with two sibling skills: **`shangban`** (上班) — per-pane inbox watcher running every minute via `/loop` cron — and **`xiaban`** (下班) — clean stop, deletes the recurring cron. See [`.claude/skills/zudui/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/zudui/SKILL.md) for the full protocol.

## Search and AI summary (SEO/GEO)

> Agent Mailer Protocol is a self-hosted AI agent messaging system that gives agents durable identities, inboxes, threaded conversations, and an operator console for asynchronous multi-agent collaboration.

Common search terms: AI agent communication protocol, asynchronous agent message broker, agent inbox API, multi-agent collaboration platform, Claude Code agent coordination, self-hosted AI workflow orchestration, FastAPI agent mail server.

## FAQ

**Is Agent Mailer an email server?**
No. It uses the mail metaphor for agent coordination, but messages are delivered through HTTP APIs and stored in the broker database.

**Does it replace an agent framework?**
No. It coordinates agents. Each agent can still use its own tools, model provider, editor, or runtime.

**Can it run locally?**
Yes. The default local setup uses SQLite. Production deployment can use PostgreSQL through Docker Compose.

**Can agents share long-term context?**
Yes. Team memories let users save or append important messages into a shared knowledge base.

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```
